1. What’s stdint.h?
Fixed-width integer types header.

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Helps with portability. The sizes of the standated int types can vary across system

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
1, 4, 4, 2

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
B, M   in Ascii. 
66, 77 in Decimal.
42, 4d in hexadecimal. 

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the total size of the file in bytes.
biSize is total size of the image only in bytes.

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
The bitmap is a top-down Bitmap and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
File not found or no permission to open/write to file.

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
We're only reading one input file.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
3

11. What does fseek do?
Moves the cursor through the file.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
the current position in file.
